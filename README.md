Project Overview: 

The project involves building a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to classify tweets as either related to natural disasters or not. Utilizing the dataset from Kaggle's "Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets" competition, the main goal is to effectively preprocess the text data, apply feature extraction techniques, and develop a robust classification model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The process encompasses data cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, and sequence padding, followed by model training and evaluation to ensure accurate classification of disaster-related tweets.

Skills Developed:

  - Data Preprocessing: Techniques for cleaning and preparing text data for analysis.
  - Text Vectorization: Using TF-IDF and tokenization for converting text to numerical features.
  - Model Building: Developing and training LSTM neural networks for text classification.
  - Evaluation Metrics: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Visualization: Creating visual representations of data distribution and model performance.

- **Tools**: 
  - Google Colab: For developing and executing the project, providing a collaborative and GPU-accelerated environment for model training.

Use Case: 

The primary use case for this project is in disaster response and management. By accurately classifying tweets related to natural disasters, emergency response teams and organizations can:

  - Real-time Monitoring: Track and monitor disaster events in real-time through social media platforms.
  - Resource Allocation: Prioritize and allocate resources more effectively based on the urgency and location of reported disasters.
  - Public Awareness: Enhance public awareness and communication by identifying and broadcasting critical disaster-related information.
  - Sentiment Analysis: Understand public sentiment and response to disaster events, aiding in improving future response strategies.

Overall, the project showcases the application of NLP techniques in addressing real-world challenges, demonstrating the potential for machine learning models to enhance disaster management efforts.
